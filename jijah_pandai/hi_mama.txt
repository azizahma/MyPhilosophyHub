SUMMARY
Django is a Python framework (not library) for creating websites.
In an environment where you have defined a Django project, you will need to do the configurations (ie.the project setting) and creating applications (eg.polls - one basic app that has been done here).
A defined project would also have a script - manage.py, that will assist in starting an app (startapp), reload website, create superuser (createsuperuser), and etc (to check: python manage.py --help).
For project setting, we can set up some specialised database that we prefer to use in the project - because we might be more familiar using SQL command compared to SQLite (which is the default).
For this we must include the name of the database to use in setting.py file (in the project dir).
Or else, a default database would be used - in this case db.sqlite3 - which initially, is empty - so we cannot perform eg. createsuperuser, before we get some tables done.
To create tables in the database (in this case db.sqlite3) we run a command python3 manage.py migrate - where it would create tables for some services that are available - in this case, admin, auth, contentypes and sessions.
Now you can create a superuser login by running python3 manage.py createsuperuser, so that in the tables created the information asked for creating the superuser is stored.
So if you go to the url http://myphilosophyhub.pythonanywhere.com/admin/ there will be a login screen.
We have also started a basic polls app where a command python3 manage.py startapp polls was used.
We need to put some settings in polls/views.py and polls/urls.py files (these files as created by the command python3 manage.py startapp polls)
--- walla you will have a first view at this url: http://myphilosophyhub.pythonanywhere.com/polls/
Okay - but what we must understand here is how the redirection works - ie. let's say what to be viewed on the (prime) site itself - http://myphilosophyhub.pythonanywhere.com/
That you must edit the /home/myphilosophyhub/myphilosophyhub/myphilosophyhub/urls.py - the last part urlpatterns=[  ] (see the file).
